# Time-Synchronization
This project implements a time synchronization protocol for embedded devices using timestamped sensor data. The system leverages ESP32 devices and a Raspberry Pi to estimate network delays and relative clock drift, offering an efficient solution for time synchronization in resource-constrained IoT environments.
